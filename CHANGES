                           BWEDIT CHANGE LOGS
                           ------------------

First released Vesion: 1.0

Changes in Version 1.1

  1. A bug related to window resizing has been fixed.
  2. Facility for customizing (and saving) various options is included.
  3. An on-line Roman-to-Bengali converter is introduced. An editor for
     Roman text is also incorporated.
  4. Error messages are added.
  5. Extensive on-line documentation is added.

Changes in Version 1.2

  1. Lots of tags are added (script tags like supersuperscript etc., tags
     for displaying text in the `fixed' font and in any arbitrary X font
     available in the system).
  2. Facility for saving and loading tags is introduced.
  3. The export functions have been thoroughly rewritten so that they can
     respect the tags.
  4. Facility to prompt the user when she wants to discard unsaved changes
     in the text area is incorporated.
  5. New bindings have been defined for the middle and right buttons of the
     mouse.

Changes in Version 1.3

  1. The on-line display below the text area of the `Edit transliterated
     text' window is added.
  2. Facility for importing text directly from the `Edit transliterated
     text' window is incorporated.
  3. The toolbar for the `Edit transliterated text' window is redesigned.
  4. Facility to prompt the user when she wants to discard unsaved changes
     in the text area of the `Edit transliterated text' window is
     introduced.
  5. Some diagnostic messages are added (for example, when a file or options
     are saved).

Changes in Version 1.4

  1. A bug related to the window resizing of the `Edit transliterated text'
     window has been fixed.
  2. Two more bugs related to the `Save confirm' windows are fixed.
  3. A bug in setting the dirty bit is also fixed.
  4. A bug related to not refreshing the on-line view in the transliterator
     window during load etc. is fixed.
  5. Another bug related to the existence of spaces in a file name etc. is
     also removed.
  6. Compatibility with bwti version 3.0 and bwfu version 1.1 is
     incorporated.
  7. Two new conjunct consonants are added.
  8. The character array is a little bit beautified.
  9. In all the previous versions, when a user wants to re-open an auxiliary
     window, she gets an error message. This is taken into account in this
     version. A re-open request now changes the focus to the existing
     window.
 10. Facility to send Bengali documents through e-mail is introduced. The
     associated 8-bit to 7-bit encoding routines and the corresponding
     decoding routines are added.
 11. Cut-copy-paste facilities are introduced for the transliterator window.
     An old bug for these operations has also been fixed.
 12. For export to LaTeX and HTML, the user is provided an option to include
     or omit the header and tailer. For LaTeX this is particularly useful.
     If the user opts to omit the header, the output LaTeX file ceases to be
     a self-sufficient LaTeX input; instead one can readily \input or
     \include the file from another LaTeX source.
 13. For export to PS, a target page selector is introduced.
 14. The option editor is modified. In particular, the `edit option' windows
     for the main window, the transliterator window and the mail operations
     are integrated into a single window. Switching between different option
     topics is made possible through radio buttons.

Changes in Version 1.5

  1. Escape sequence to insert all characters in the main editor window is
     introduced.
  2. Keyboard accelerators (other than the escape sequence) for all vowels,
     jafala and rafala are introduced for the main window.
  3. The `View Keyboard Map' window is redesigned.
  4. Keyboard bindings are added for both the main and the transliterator
     windows for the keys F1 through F10.
  5. Keyboard bindings for deleting and joining words and lines are added
     for both the main and the transliterator windows.
  6. The `Cancel' option is introduced for `Save confirm' windows.
  7. A documentation bug is removed.
  8. Another bug related to an icon name is fixed.

Changes in Version 2.0

  1. Facility to open multiple main and editor windows is introduced. All
     routines are updated accordingly.
  2. The coordinator window is added. This contains a tool bar, image
     buttons and balloon messages.
  3. The mail reader is introduced.
  4. Keyboard bindings are changed somewhat. In particular, the Alt-M
     bindings that create troubles with older versions of Tcl/Tk are
     completely removed. The Alt bindings are made more-or-less uniform
     for three types of windows (coordinator, main, transliterator).
  5. Facility to append transliterated file in main window is added.
  6. Facility to insert and append file is introduced for transliterator
     windows.
  7. The help windows (`About bwedit' and `Transliteration rules') have
     been redesigned. Help topics are displayed so that the user can directly
     click on them (instead of selecting the topics from a menu). The
     help windows are no longer fixed size windows. The user can resize
     them.
  8. The character array below the text area is removed. The functionality
     of this array is imposed on the keyboard map window.
  9. Facility to insert transliteration encodings of the Bengali characters
     to the transliterator window is also incorporated through proper
     bindings in the keyboard map window.
 10. The Roman alphabet is added to the keyboard map window.
 11. The `Send Mail' window is reconfigured. More specifically, the user is
     provided a choice to send either a hard disk file or a main window text
     or a transliterator window text.
 12. The restriction on encoding of transliterator text is removed. All
     types of encoding are now allowed for each type of mail body (file,
     main text and transliterator text).
 13. The send-mail and options dialog boxes no longer grab the focus. One
     can continue editing tasks with these dialog boxes open.
 14. A bug related to incrementing the dirty bit when digits are input is
     fixed.
 15. The menu binding functions bindings are changed so that they no longer
     rely on Tk's default action.
 16. The options EditRoman (Launch transliterator window at start-up) and
     CharMap (Show character array below the main text area) are no longer
     supported.
 17. This version does not take into account the command line arguments.
 18. The help files are updated a little in order to have conformity with the
     new GUI as well as to explain things better.
 19. The size of diagnostic message dialog boxes is made dynamic so that the
     text plus all the buttons fit nicely in it irrespective of the user's
     choice of default fonts.
 20. A target window selector is added for the [Transfer] menu of
     transliterator windows and in the [keyboard map] window.

Changes in Version 2.1

  1. A bug in the tag functions is removed. If the user does not select a
     region and calls these tag functions, this bug used to appear.
  2. The conjunct "ndh" was omitted from the keyboard map list in versions
     1.5 and 2.0. This is properly inserted in this version.
  3. A bug related to setting of the dirty bit in the main window when the
     user invokes the keyboard accelerators (Alt+1), (Alt+2) etc. is fixed.
  4. The cursor is changed from the default to the `hand' cursor on clickable
     items that are not buttons or that do not look like buttons. (Examples:
     Help window topics, BWEDIT logos and Keyboard map characters)
  5. The default text in the target window selector menu button in the
     keyboard map window is changed from `Select target window' to `Target
     window : (None)'.
  6. Facility to insert Roman text in transliterator window is introduced.
  7. The ligatures `r + u', `r + U', ..., `st + u' are properly handled in
     the transliterator window.
  8. Automatic saving and loading of tags are incorporated. Load/Save/Append/
     Insert operations on main window files are updated accordingly.
  9. The command-line options -m, -t, -nm, -nt, -bw, -uu, -mime, -e, -rm, -k,
     -f, -hl, -h and -v are introduced.
 10. The user is allowed to read Roman-to-Bengali conversion encoding from
     a file of his/her choice. This overrides the system default stored in
     `<INSTALLDIR>/lib/bn.enc'.

Changes in Version 2.2

  1. The `Get File Name' dialog box is augmented so that it shows the
     directory listing, when the user chooses a directory and tries to
     commit (by hitting Return or clicking `Ok').
  2. Facility to change folder for reading mails is introduced. The folder
     info above the list of headers is added.
  3. Procedures for moving through the list of mails are introduced. These
     procedures include: Next, Previous, Ten mails forward, Ten mails backward,
     First, Last, Goto mail with arbitrary number or with arbitrary
     forward/backward shift.
  4. The `Edit mail' option is introduced in the `Read Mail' window. The user
     can now send contents of the edited mail by the send mail utility.
  5. The `Reply-to' field of a mail header is taken care of for sending reply
     to e-mails.
  6. Text search and replace functions are added for both the main and the
     transliterator windows.
  7. Facility for automatic refreshing of lists of target windows is added.
     This refresh routine is invoked whenever a main or transliterator window
     is created or closed. The refreshing takes place in the following places:
     a) list of main windows for transfering transliterated text, maintained
        in transliterator windows
     b) list of target windows (main and transliterator) maintained by the
        keyboard map window
     c) list of main and transliterator windows maintained by the sendmail
        dialog box to select the content of an e-mail
     The refresh buttons and menu entries that invoked these functions have
     been removed. The user no longer has to do it forcibly.
  8. A bug related to setting of the source editor window for the send-mail
     dialog box is removed.
  9. The method of printing # in Roman mode is revised. In version 2.1, when
     the user wants to print # in transliterator windows while (s)he is in
     the roman mode, (s)he had to come to bengali mode, then type 2 hashes
     and again switch to roman mode. This means a set of 4 consecutive hashes.
     This is ugly. Now the user can print # by typing two of them in the roman
     mode too.
 10. A limit (5) on the number of blank main and transliterator windows to
     launch at start-up is imposed. This does not allow the user to open an
     arbitrary number of windows and hang the system (accidentally or
     intentionally).
 11. A man page for bwedit is added.

Changes in version 3.0

  1. Tcl/Tk introduced Unicode features from Version 8.1 onwards. This
     causes serious display problems for certain Bengali glyphs. More
     specifically, characters with the encodings 00 to 31 are displayed
     as special control sequences \x00 - \x1f. This makes a massively
     confusing output in the editor's text areas. I could not find an
     easy solution to the problem. I had to relocate the offending
     characters elsewhere. But since bwfu font files were already almost
     full as 8-bit font files, I had to use encodings beyond 255.
     Fortunately the BDF format supports this. Now text display is
     carried out by two commands encfrom and encto which essentially
     mimics the Tcl commands "encoding convertfrom" and "encoding convertto".
     These two builtin Tcl routines could have been straightaway used, but they
     call for having a bwfu2.enc file in Tcl's library path. This means that
     the user will have to either have root password for writing bwfu2.enc in
     the Tcl library path or copy the complete Tcl library to his/her own
     home area. Having our customized encfrom and encto relieves the users
     from both these overheads, but we may perhaps have to sacrifice some speed.

  2. The relocation of the characters in the original BDF files called
     for a new set of BDF files to be generated. These files (together with
     the older ones) are now bundled with the bwedit distribution. The user
     don't have to download bwfu X11font files separately, but have to go to
     the BDF directory for installing all the BDF files.

  3. The encoding files bwfu.enc and bwfu2.enc for BWFU<->Unicode conversions
     are also provided in the distribution, but the bwedit code does not make use
     of these.

  4. The sequence of writing and reading tags in main windows (and also for
     bwencoding of mails) has been changed. Now the tags denoting fonts
     (bengali*, english and customfont tags must come earlier than the underline
     and script tags. This introduces incompatibilities with the older
     versions of bwedit.

  5. The "Goto line" facility is added to both the main and transliterator
     windows.

  6. Export commands are made available for transliterator windows. The
     formats currently supported are Bengali text (under the bwfu encdoing),
     ISCII, HTML, LaTeX and PostScript. A transliterator text does not have
     tags, but the inclusion of text in Roman fonts is taken care of.

  7. The export commands from transliterator windows are not
     handled by Tcl codes. A helper application bwconv is written in
     C for doing the conversions. This speeds up conversion considerably,
     though for typical small files this is rather insignificant.

  8. The encoding (in bn.enc) has been made much more flexible. One can
     now even work with one's customized definition of vowel and consonant
     symbols. Both bwconv and bwedit follow these flexible rules.

  9. A spell checker for Romanized editing is added. This definitely calls
     for a Bengali word database. One reasonably huge database is supplied
     with the distribution.

 10. Again spell checking is handled not by bwedit itself, but by a
     C application bwspell. This was absolutely necessary for the sake
     of efficiency. Tcl scripts take huge time just for reading and storing
     the wordlist database.

 11. An alphabetic listing of allowed Bengali words can be displayed
     on-line. This may help users manually correct spelling errors.

 12. A new command line option -wl is added. If this option is specified,
     the word list window is launched at startup.

 13. Indexing of help topics in the help window has been changed a bit.
     Menus and submenus are added for neater display.

 14. A bug in the Bengali->HTML conversion in main windows is removed.

 15. The online-view in the transliterator windows have been made scrollable
     for effective display of long lines.

 16. The `Select document font' button in the coordinator window has been
     replaced by the `Show wordlist' button. This operation is seemingly more
     important so that there should be a short-cut for it.

 17. A small bug in Roman-to-Bengali conversion is removed.

 18. All gif files in the images directory have been changed to the ppm
     format. This has been done not for efficiency, but to avoid possible proprietary
     violations caused by the LZW compression algorithm used by the GIF
     format. (Look at http://burnallgifs.org/.)

 19. The application now by default does not show any red color. Previous
     red patches in some image files have been changed to magenta. The reason
     may be aesthetic, or conformity with conventional aesthetics.

 20. A decision has been taken to bundle the PostScript font file
     bnr.gsf with the distribution.

 21. Separate documents on `conversion to ISCII' and the `bwspell spell
     checking algorithm' are provided.

 22. The GNU General Public License for copying/modifying/distributing
     is adopted.
