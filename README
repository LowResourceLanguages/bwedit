                       BWEDIT - A Bengali text editor

                           Version 3.0 (July 2002)

Welcome to the experimental Bengali text editor bwedit. It runs on any X11
window system having the Tcl/Tk shell wish. It provides a very easy-to-use
and effective graphical interface. This experimental version of bwedit has
evolved to be a rather sophisticated text editor. It supports two editing
modes: writing directly in Bengali and writing in Romanized Bengali.
It incorporates many features commonly found in modern editors. In addition,
it is capable of converting Bengali text files to html, LaTeX, ISCII and
PostScript. Spell checking facilities are also provided for the Romanized
editing mode. Limited facilities for reading and sending mails are also
included.


Requirements

  1. The Tcl/Tk shell wish
  2. The X11 bitmap fonts available from the bwfu distribution.
  3. The TeX fonts and a style file available from the bwti distribution, if
     you want to compile the exported output in the LaTeX format.
  4. The PostScript Type 1 fonts available from the bwfu distribution, for
     exporting Bengali documents to PostScript files.

The first two are absolutely necessary for bwedit to work. The others are
optional and needed, if you want to export Bengali documents to the desired
formats. The X11 and PostScript fonts are bundled with bwedit, whereas
the TeX interface bwti can be downloaded from my pages. Tcl/Tk can be
downloaded from http://www.tcl.tk/.
