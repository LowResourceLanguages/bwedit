                       INSTALLING THE BDF FONTS
                       ------------------------

   X11 can read fonts in several formats. These are BDF (Bitmap Distribution
   Format), PCF (Potable Compiled Format) etc. A BDF file is a text file
   that defines the bitmap patterns for the characters of a font.

   bwedit depends on a family of BDF fonts, namely the `bengali' family.
   Both normal (upright) and slanted versions of fonts of this family are
   available at dpi values 100, 120, 150, 180, 210, 250, 300 and 360.

   Before you run bwedit, you must add these fonts to your X11 font
   list. The installation procedure is easy, but often confusing. You should
   follow the steps given below:

1. Copy the bdf files (The 32 files bn*.bdf in this directory) to a
   directory. Let us call this directory <bnfontdir>. Note that the
   directory name <bnfontdir> must be an absolute name. No relative
   paths (like ./X11fonts, ~/Xfonts/Bengali etc.) are supported
   by some of the commands discussed below.

   Though X11 normally works well with BDF files, you may convert the BDF
   files to the format PCF (portable compiled format) using the program
   bdftopcf available with most X11 distributions. For example,

      bdftopcf bnr10.100.bdf > bnr10.100.pcf

   generates the file bnr10.100.pcf from the BDF file bnr10.100.bdf.

   In order to save space, you may compress the BDF (and PCF) files as

      compress <bnfontdir>/bnr10.100.bdf
      compress <bnfontdir>/bnr10.100.pcf

   These generate files bnr10.100.bdf.Z, bnr10.100.pcf.Z etc.
   Some distributions of X windows also allow one to have gzip-ped
   versions of BDF and PCF fonts.


2. Type at the shell prompt:

      mkfontdir <bnfontdir>

   This command creates a file called fonts.dir in the directory
   <bnfontdir>. If <bnfontdir> already contains a (valid)
   fonts.dir, it is not necessary to call mkfontdir.


3. Now call xset to add <bnfontdir> to the X11 font search path as

      xset fp+ <bnfontdir>

   This is an important step and leads to unwelcome situations
   for inexperienced users.

   Note, first of all, that every time you run X11 windows, you must perform
   this step. Whenever you exit from the window, information about the
   previous installation of Bengali fonts is lost. If you really intend to
   make this information *permanent* (so that Bengali fonts are added
   by default at startup of X windows), you must either copy the BDF (or
   PCF) files to one of X11's default font directories and update the
   fonts.dir in that directory, or add <bnfontdir> to your X11
   font search path. If your X Windows loads fonts using xfs (X Font Server),
   you may alternatively set the configuration file of xfs (after placing
   the BDF or PCF fonts in some suitable directory and creating the fonts.dir
   there). Ask your system administrator to do that for you.

   The second point to be noted in this respect is that xset does
   not support relative path names. That is, <bnfontdir> must
   be an absolute path name as discussed earlier.

   Third, xset assumes that <bnfontdir> is a local directory
   irrespective of whether you run it from the local machine (X server)
   or from a remote machine (X client) (via telnet, setenv DISPLAY etc.).
   If your bwedit resides in a remote machine, no problem! It's only required
   that your X11 fonts must reside in your *local* machine. An alternate
   font server can be specified by the command xfs. Again disturb
   your system administrator in order to know how to use that command.

Steps 2 and 3 above can be performed by the shell script xaddbnfonts
residing in this directory. Edit this shell script and change the line

   bnfontdir="/usr/local/bwedit/BDF"

according as your <bnfontdir>. Then run xaddbnfonts. For
some operaing systems, a line in this script containing

   if test -e $bnfontdir/fonts.dir

creates trouble. If you face that, change the -e to -f,
that is, the modified line should be:

   if test -f $bnfontdir/fonts.dir

In order to check if you have properly installed fonts in the `bengali'
and `bengali2' families, type

   xlsfonts | grep bengali

at the command prompt. This gives a list of Bengali fonts recognized
by your X server. If the list is empty, you are in trouble. You cannot
run bwedit. Ask an X11 windows expert to know what went wrong. On the
other hand, if you get a set of lines of the form

   -*-bengali-medium-o-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-fontspecific
   -*-bengali-medium-r-*-*-*-300-*-*-*-*-*-fontspecific

etc., you are ready for the show. In case, you want to view the complete
character map of these fonts before running bwedit, call xfd as

   xfd -fn "-*-bengali-medium-o-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-fontspecific"
   xfd -fn "-*-bengali-medium-r-*-*-*-300-*-*-*-*-*-fontspecific"

Another X application

   xfontsel

displays X11 fonts interactively. Choose the font families `bengali'
and `bengali2' and select the approprate point size to view the Bengali
fonts at different sizes. Note that bengali2 fonts may have some
display problems with the xfd and xfontsel applications. But the
list command (xlsfonts) must list all the 16 fonts in the bengali2
family (and 16 more in the bengali family).
