                      Installation procedure for bwedit3.0
                      ------------------------------------

 1. First install the BDF font files in ./BDF. Read the file BDF/INSTALL
    in order to know how to do this. Note that this is a difficult process
    and may create problems to users not reasonably familiar with X windows.

 2. To check if your X server can read the Bengali fonts, type

       xlsfonts | grep bengali

    This gives you a listing of 32 fonts used by bwedit. The bengali family
    will be needed with older versions (<= 8.0) of Tcl/Tk. New versions of
    Tcl/Tk require the bengali2 family. You may install only the required
    family, if you have to minimize storage. But it may be a better idea to
    install BDF fonts of both the families.

 3. Check if you have Tcl/Tk. Just type `wish' at the shell prompt. If you
    find that something happens (apart from Command not found), you are
    ready for the show.

    (bwedit might as well run on `expect' (instead of wish). Try it. Do some
    engineering at the beginning of the script src/bwedit and install it.)

 4. Optionally install the bwti TeX fonts and style file. These are not
    bundled with this bwedit distribution, but can be downloaded separately.

 5. Edit src/bwedit. Change installdir (line 42) according as where you
    want to install bwedit. The default is /usr/local/bwedit. If you have
    root permission, go for it. If you don't have root permission and/or if
    you want to avoid writing in the root area, choose some directory under
    your home directory. If your home directory is, say, /home/<username>,
    the choice /home/<username>/bwedit is reasonable.

    In addition you will have to decide a value (0 or 1) for the flag
    newTclTk. A simple rule to set this is: Use the value 1 if you
    have versions 8.1 onwards of Tcl/Tk, and the value 0, if you have
    versions 8.0 or below of Tcl/Tk. In order to know what versions are
    installed in your machine, type wish at the shell prompt. This will
    launch a small square blank window and will also issue you a prompt
    (typically %) in your shell for reading your input. Type

       echo $tcl_version

    and

       echo $tk_version

    at this prompt to know the desired values. (Finally, type exit
    to terminate the execution of wish.)

 6. If you have changed the installation directory in Step 5, you must also
    do the following:

    - Edit Makefile. Change INSTALL_DIR, BIN_DIR and MAN_DIR (Lines 30, 33
      and 36). INSTALL_DIR should be the same as installdir of bwedit.
      BIN_DIR should be a directory in your search path, where you have
      write permission. Many users, for example, include ~/bin in their
      execution search path. The MAN_DIR is necessary, only if you want
      to install the bwedit man-page. If you cannot decide a suitable
      directory for it, forget it, and don't try "make installman" in
      Step 7.

    - Edit src/bwconv.c and src/bwspell.c and change ENCFILE, BWTIENCFILE,
      ISCIIENCFILE, DICTFILE and CASEFILE (Lines 43-46). (Note that both
      these codes do not require all the 5 values. Change only those
      appearing in the #define statements.) These special library files
      must reside in the directory <installdir>/lib and must have the
      respective names bn.enc, bwti.enc, iscii.enc, bw.dct and bw.cse.

 7. Type

       make install

    at the command prompt. In addition, if you are interested in installing
    the bwedit man page, type:

        make installman

 8. Now run bwedit as

        bwedit

    at the shell prompt. You may have to specify the complete path of bwedit,
    if your BIN_DIR (See Step 6) is not in your execution search path. If you
    use csh, open a new shell for the new command bwedit in BIN_DIR to get
    registered. bwedit supports a number of command-line options. Run

        bwedit -h

    to have an overview of the command line options. Alternatively, read
    the bwedit manpage or use the on-line help of bwedit.

 9. The examples directory has some small example files. Here is a short
    description of these:

    example1.bng   History of the Roman calendar to be loaded in main windows
    example2.btx   The same but to be loaded in transliterator windows
    example3.bng   A file showing all the tags supported by main windows
    allchars.bng   Another main window file showing all the characters

    You should see legible Bengali text, when you load these example files
    in appropriate windows. If bwedit refuses to run after complaining that
    "I cannot see Bengali fonts", then your installation of the Bengali
    fonts was not successful. Install them properly and rerun bwedit.
    If you do not see intelligible texts even after loading the example
    files, check again, if you have followed all the above steps carefully.
    If yes and you still face a problem, try after swapping the value
    of newTclTk in src/bwedit and then reinstalling. If you still have
    complaints, write to me (ad_rab@yahoo.com).

Enjoy bwedit...
