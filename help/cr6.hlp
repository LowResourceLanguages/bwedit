                       6. CONCLUSION

I hope that the conversion rules are simple and useful.
However, some people do not prefer any Roman-to-Bengali
converter at all. They feel that the main edit window
for Bengali text together with the clickable character
array is sufficient for them. You have the privilege to
have your own choice. I, as a designer, do not.

Have a nice time with bwedit.
