      TRANSLITERATOR WINDOW : THE ON-LINE VIEW

A one-line display below the text area shows the
transliterated version of the Roman text contained in
the line currently edited in the text area (that is,
the line containing the insert cursor in the text area).
This helps the user to have an on-line check of what
(s)he is writing in the text area, before this text
(or parts of it) are transfered to the main editor
window or exported to a file.
